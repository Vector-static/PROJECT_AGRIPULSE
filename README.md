# PROJECT_AGRIPULSE
 THIS PROJECT IS BASCIALLY WRITTEN IN PYTHON BUT THE  MODEL USED HERE IS RANDOM FOREST REGRESOR.
 THEN THIS MODEL IS TRAINED ON A CROP YEILD DATASET(AVAILABLE ON KAGGLE) WITH A TRAIN TO TEST RATIO OF 70:30.
 THEN THE MODEL IS DEPLOYED, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY REDICTS THE CROP YEILD BASED ON SOME FACTORS/INPUTS FROM USER LIKE POTTASIUM LEVEL OR NITROGEN LEVEL OR FERTILIZER QUANTITY.
 THIS MODEL IS ALSO TESTED ON PERFORMANCE METRICS LIKE MSE(MEAN SQUARED ERROR) AND R^2 VALUES.
MSE: MSE is calculated as the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values.
MSE value 0.51 indicates that, on average, the squared differences between the actual crop yields and the predicted yields are 0.51.
R-SQUARED VALUE:The R-squared (RÂ²) value is a measure of how well the predicted values match the actual values. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
R-SQUARED VALUE of 0.89 means that 89% of the variance in the crop yield is explained by the model. This is a strong indicator that your model fits the data well.
CONCLUSION:HIGH MSE VALUE OF 0.51 SUGGESTS THE SQUARED DEVIATION OF THIS MODEL AND ACTUAL CROP YEILDS,R-SQUARED VALUE OF 0.89 SUGGESTS A GREAT FITTING AND AN OVERALL VARIANCE, INDICATING A GREAT PERFORMANCE.
